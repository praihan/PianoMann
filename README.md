# PianoMann

A Karplus-Strong piano synthesizer.

## Building

1. Get [JUCE](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce). You may need to create a user account. These are the instructions from the official tutorial.

   > Download JUCE. Unpack the JUCE folder and place it to some location on your computer. Your user home folder is a convenient place.
   > Go into the JUCE folder you just installed. Launch the Projucer, which is located there.

2. Open `PianoMann.jucer` with Projucer (included with JUCE).

3. Use Projucer UI to create native project files:

   - Makefiles on Linux
   - Visual Studio Solution on Windows
   - XCode project on macOS

4. Build the JUCE application or VST3 plugin.

5. Profit!
